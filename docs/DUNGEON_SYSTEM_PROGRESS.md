# Daggerfall Clone - Dungeon System Progress Overview

**Date:** July 31, 2025  
**Status:** Simplified Unified System - Stable Foundation Complete

## üéØ **Project Vision**
Creating an authentic Daggerfall-style dungeon crawler with procedural room-and-corridor dungeons that provide exploration, variety, and that classic dungeon atmosphere.

---

## üìà **Development Journey**

### **Phase 1: Initial Attempts (Rejected)**
- **Maze-based Generation**: Started with algorithmic maze generation
- **User Feedback**: "this is bad" - too cramped and confusing
- **Issue**: Players getting trapped in single rooms
- **Decision**: Complete system redesign needed

### **Phase 2: Comprehensive Daggerfall System**
- **Architecture**: Implemented full 4-phase generation pipeline
- **Room Types**: 5 distinct room types with size ranges
- **Corridor System**: L-shaped pathfinding with proper connectivity
- **Success**: Multi-room exploration with proper navigation

### **Phase 3: Advanced Height Variations (Overcomplicated)**
- **Wall Heights**: Room-specific ceiling heights (2.5-12.0 units)
- **Smart Merging**: Complex gap-filling algorithms
- **Corridor Logic**: Height matching based on tallest connected rooms
- **Issue**: System became overly complex with visual gaps

### **Phase 4: Simplified Unified System (Current)**
- **Decision**: "Let's keep it simple for now"
- **Approach**: Single 4.0 unit height for all elements
- **Result**: Clean, stable, gap-free architecture
