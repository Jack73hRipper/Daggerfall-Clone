# Core Systems Design

## Player Controller System

### Movement
- **First-person perspective** with Doom-style responsive controls
- **Speed variations**: Walk (5 m/s), Run (8 m/s), Crouch (2.5 m/s)
- **Physics-based** movement with proper friction and acceleration
- **Jump mechanics** with realistic gravity (25 m/s²)
- **Encumbrance effects** based on carried weight vs. STR stat

### Stats Integration
- **STR**: Affects carrying capacity and melee damage
- **DEX**: Affects movement speed and ranged accuracy
- **CON**: Affects health and stamina
- **INT**: Affects mana and spell effectiveness
- **WIS**: Affects perception and trap detection
- **CHA**: Affects NPC interactions (future feature)

## Item System

### Physics-Based Interaction
- All items are **RigidBody3D** with realistic physics
- **Sprite3D** visuals for authentic retro aesthetic
- **Weight affects movement** - heavier load = slower speed
- **Free-form dropping/trading** between players
- **Durability system** - items degrade with use

### Item Categories
- **Weapons**: Swords, axes, bows, staves
- **Armor**: Helmet, chest, legs, boots, gloves, shield
- **Consumables**: Potions, food, scrolls
- **Materials**: Crafting components, ore, leather
- **Quest Items**: Story-specific objects

## Combat System

### Damage Calculation
```
Base Damage = Weapon Damage + STR Modifier (for melee)
Final Damage = Base Damage - Target Defense
Critical Hit = Base Damage × 2 (on natural 20)
```

### Combat Actions
- **Basic Attack**: Standard weapon swing/shot
- **Power Attack**: Slower but higher damage (costs stamina)
- **Block**: Reduce incoming damage with shield/weapon
- **Dodge Roll**: Quick evasion maneuver (costs stamina)

## Dungeon Generation

### Room-and-Corridor Algorithm
1. **Place entrance room** at bottom of level
2. **Generate 8-15 rooms** of varying sizes
3. **Connect with corridors** ensuring all rooms accessible
4. **Add dead ends** for exploration variety (20% chance)
5. **Place treasure rooms** in distant locations (30% chance)

### Room Types
- **Chamber**: Large open areas for combat encounters
- **Corridor**: Connecting passages, potential trap locations
- **Treasure**: High-value loot, heavily guarded
- **Entrance**: Player spawn point
- **Boss**: Special encounters (future feature)

## Cooperative Gameplay

### Group Progression
- **All players must reach stairs** to advance floor
- **Shared loot philosophy** - no loot protection
- **Natural role specialization** through stat differences
- **STR characters** become group pack mules
- **Group decision making** for major choices

### Communication
- **Proximity voice chat** (future multiplayer feature)
- **Text chat system** for coordination
- **Ping system** to mark locations/items
- **Gesture system** for non-verbal communication

## Progression Systems

### Experience and Leveling
- **Kill XP**: Defeating enemies grants experience
- **Discovery XP**: Finding secret areas/treasure
- **Quest XP**: Completing objectives (future feature)
- **Shared XP**: All players in party get equal shares

### Character Development
- **Stat increases** on level up
- **Skill unlocks** based on playstyle
- **Equipment mastery** - bonuses for using weapon types
- **Party synergies** - bonuses for diverse group composition

## User Interface

### HUD Elements
- **Health/Stamina/Mana bars** in corner
- **Hotkey bar** (1-10 keys) for quick item access
- **Compass** showing cardinal directions
- **Minimap** (future feature)
- **Status effects** indicator

### Inventory System
- **Grid-based inventory** with weight visualization
- **Equipment slots** for worn items
- **Sorting options** by type, weight, value
- **Item tooltips** with full stats
- **Trade window** for player exchanges

## Audio Design

### 3D Positional Audio
- **Footsteps** vary by surface material
- **Combat sounds** with distance falloff
- **Environmental audio** for atmosphere
- **Voice lines** for player communication

### Music System
- **Dynamic music** that responds to gameplay
- **Exploration tracks** for dungeon wandering
- **Combat music** during encounters
- **Tension music** for dangerous areas

## Performance Targets

### Technical Requirements
- **60 FPS minimum** with 4 players
- **4MB network usage** per minute maximum
- **Low system requirements** - runs on older hardware
- **Quick loading times** under 5 seconds between floors

### Optimization Strategies
- **Object pooling** for frequently spawned items
- **LOD systems** for distant objects
- **Texture streaming** for large sprite collections
- **Network prediction** for smooth multiplayer
