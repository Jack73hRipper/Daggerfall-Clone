# üó°Ô∏è Combat System Testing Guide

## Quick Start Combat Testing

### **1. Launch & Setup**
- Open the project in Godot
- Run the main scene (`TestScene.tscn`)
- Use **WASD** to move, **mouse** to look around
- Press **Shift** to sprint

### **2. Get a Weapon**
- **Weapons now spawn automatically!**
- **Sword**: Spawns in the **first room** (where you start), offset to the right
- **Dagger**: Spawns in the **second room**, offset to the left
- Walk up to a weapon and press **E** to pick it up
- The weapon will appear in your view and attach to your camera

### **3. Find Targets**
- Look for **animated 3D character enemies** in the dungeon rooms
- **Warriors and Rogues** spawn randomly with full animations
- Characters play **idle animations** when standing around
- They switch to **combat stances** when you get close (5 unit range)
- 2-3 character targets automatically spawn in different rooms
- Each target has **30 HP** and shows damage feedback

### **4. Combat Testing**
- **Left-click** to attack with your equipped weapon
- Watch the **weapon swing animation**
- Enemies play **hit reaction animations** when damaged
- Enemies play **death animations** when defeated
- See **console output** for damage dealt and target health
- Targets are **destroyed** after death animation completes

### **5. Advanced Testing**
- Press **F5** to regenerate the dungeon and respawn targets
- Try both **sword** (15 damage, slower) and **dagger** (faster attacks)
- Test **attack cooldown** - rapid clicking won't work
- **Hit detection** only active during swing animation

## Expected Results

### **‚úÖ Working Features**
- Smooth weapon pickup and attachment
- Left-click attack with visual swing
- **Animated character enemies with full animation sets**
- **Dynamic enemy reactions to player proximity**
- **Hit reaction animations** when enemies take damage
- **Death animations** with proper cleanup
- Damage dealt to targets with console feedback
- Attack cooldown prevents button mashing
- Weapon-specific attack speeds and damage
- Targets play idle/combat animations based on player distance

### **üîß Debug Output**
Console should show:
```
Equipped [WeaponName] for combat
Attacking with [WeaponName]
Hit TestTarget with [weapon_type] for [damage] damage!
AnimatedTarget took [damage] damage! Health: [current]/30
Playing animation: RecieveHit on [EnemyName]
Playing animation: Death on [EnemyName]
AnimatedTarget destroyed with style!
```

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations**
- No audio effects yet
- No visual hit effects (planned)
- **Character targets now have full animation sets!** ‚úÖ
- Enemy AI still basic (proximity detection only)
- Console-only damage feedback

## Next Development Phase
This combat foundation is ready for:
- Audio integration (swing/hit sounds)
- Visual effects (particles, screen shake)
- Enemy AI and movement
- Combat UI (health bars, damage numbers)
- Advanced weapon mechanics

**The core combat loop is functional and ready for expansion!**
