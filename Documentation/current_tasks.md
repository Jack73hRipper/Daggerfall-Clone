  - [x] Enhance Main.tscn scene management
  - [x] Implement proper scene transition system
  - [x] Add scene persistence for player position
  - [x] Create basic save/load functionality for position

### Weekend Tasks (Optional)
- [ ] Create basic tilemap for overworld
- [ ] Add placeholder graphics
- [ ] Test save/load with player position
- [ ] Initial playtesting

## Next Week Preview
- Basic UI framework development
- Inventory system foundation
- Character sheet interface
- Main menu implementation

## Notes
- Keep systems modular and well-documented
- Test each component before moving to the next
- Update roadmap with any timeline adjustments
- Commit code daily with meaningful messages

## Blockers
- None currently identified

## Questions/Decisions Needed ✅
- [x] Pixel art style vs. simple geometric shapes for prototyping? → **User provided sprite, using pixel art**
- [x] Grid size for movement (32x32 vs. 64x64 pixels)? → **32x32 pixels chosen**
- [x] Camera zoom levels and constraints? → **2x zoom, smooth follow camera**
- [x] Turn system approach? → **True turn-based like Caves of Qud - input triggers world turn**

## Implementation Details
- **Movement**: 0.2 second smooth animation, blocks input until complete
- **Turn System**: Player action triggers world turn processing
- **Grid**: 32x32 pixel grid with smooth interpolation
- **Camera**: 2x zoom with smooth following
