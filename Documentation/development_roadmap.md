## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Procedural Generation Complexity**
   - *Risk*: System becomes too complex to maintain
   - *Mitigation*: Start simple, iterate gradually, maintain clear documentation

2. **Save System with Complex Data**
   - *Risk*: Save corruption or version incompatibility
   - *Mitigation*: Version all save formats, implement backup systems, test thoroughly

3. **Turn-Based AI Performance**
   - *Risk*: AI calculations slow down gameplay
   - *Mitigation*: Profile early, optimize algorithms, implement time limits

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Feature Scope Creep**
   - *Mitigation*: Stick to roadmap, defer nice-to-have features to post-launch

2. **Art Asset Pipeline**
   - *Mitigation*: Use placeholder art, establish clear asset requirements early
