# Daggerfall Clone - Solo Developer Project Plan

## Project Overview
A 3D dungeon crawler combining elements of Daggerfall, Doom, Caves of Qud, and Barony. Built in Godot 4 with low-poly pixelated graphics using purchased dark fantasy sprite assets.

**Developer Role**: CEO, Developer, Artist, Coder (Solo Development)
**Target Audience**: Personal enjoyment and friends, potential broader release
**Distribution**: itch.io first, Steam later
**Platform**: Windows only initially

## Core Game Vision
- **Movement**: Doom-style responsive first-person controls, slightly slower paced
- **Dungeons**: Procedurally generated with open chambers and maze-like corridors
- **Loot**: Physics-based item interactions, weight/durability systems, deliberate drops
- **Combat**: Tactical encounters with D&D 5E-inspired stat system
- **Multiplayer**: 4-player cooperative (ambitious scope - consider single-player first)

## Visual Style & Assets
- Low-poly, pixelated aesthetic
- **Architecture**: BoxMesh geometry with 2D sprite textures
- **Characters/Enemies**: Isometric sprites (purchased dark fantasy collection)
  - Fixed rotation or angle-switching implementation
- **Items**: Sprite3D pickups with physics interaction
- **Specs**: Low system requirements, runnable on all computers

## Solo Development Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
**Priority: Get something playable quickly**
1. **Single-Player First**
   - Basic first-person movement (WASD + mouse)
   - Simple test dungeon (hand-built rooms)
   - Physics-based item pickup/drop
   - Basic combat system

2. **Asset Integration**
   - Implement isometric sprite system
   - Test sprite-to-3D adaptation approaches
   - Basic item visual system

### Phase 2: Core Systems (Weeks 4-8)
3. **Procedural Generation**
   - Room-and-corridor algorithm
   - Item/enemy spawn points
   - Basic dungeon variety

4. **Character Progression**
   - D&D 5E stat system implementation
   - Inventory and weight mechanics
   - Basic leveling/progression

### Phase 3: Polish & Content (Weeks 9-12)
5. **Content Expansion**
   - More enemy types from sprite collection
   - Varied item types and rarities
   - Dungeon themes and variety

6. **Quality of Life**
   - Customizable hotkeys (1-10 keys)
   - Basic tutorial system
   - Settings and options

### Phase 4: Multiplayer (Weeks 13+)
**OPTIONAL - Consider this a separate project phase**
7. **Networking Implementation**
   - Start with 2-player, expand to 4
   - Host-client architecture
   - Synchronization systems

## Solo Developer Workflow

### Time Management
- **Sprint Length**: 1 week (shorter for faster feedback)
- **Daily Goals**: 2-3 hours focused development
- **Weekly Review**: What worked? What didn't? Adjust next week
- **Passion-Driven Days**: Work on whatever excites you most to maintain motivation

### Documentation Strategy
- **Design Journal**: Document all decisions and reasoning
- **Progress Log**: Weekly screenshots and feature videos
- **Code Comments**: Future you will forget everything
- **Git Commits**: Detailed commit messages for tracking progress

### Burnout Prevention
- **Scope Flexibility**: Cut features ruthlessly if needed
- **Prototype First**: Build rough versions before polishing
- **Celebrate Small Wins**: Share progress screenshots, even tiny ones
- **Take Breaks**: Guilt-free rest days when needed

### Version Control
- **Repository**: Private GitHub repo
- **Branches**: main, develop, feature branches for major systems
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular pushes, occasional zip backups
- **Asset Management**: Git LFS for large sprite files

## Community & Feedback

### Discord Server Setup
- **Channels**: #general, #development-updates, #testing, #feedback
- **Early Access**: Invite close friends for testing rough builds
- **Progress Sharing**: Regular development screenshots and videos
- **Feedback Integration**: Weekly review of community suggestions

### Release Strategy
1. **Friends Beta**: Close testing group for core mechanics
2. **itch.io Early Access**: Broader testing, gather feedback
3. **Steam Release**: Polished version with marketing push

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Multiplayer Complexity**: Start single-player, add networking later
- **Sprite Integration**: Test early, have fallback to simple 3D models
- **Performance**: Profile regularly, target 60fps minimum
- **Scope Creep**: Maintain strict feature list, resist additions

### Personal Risks
- **Burnout**: Built-in break days, flexible deadlines
- **Isolation**: Regular community engagement, progress sharing
- **Decision Fatigue**: Limit daily decisions, batch similar tasks
- **Perfectionism**: Ship rough but functional over polished but incomplete

## Success Metrics
- **Technical**: Stable 60fps, functional core loop
- **Personal**: Enjoyable to play with friends
- **Community**: Positive feedback from testers
- **Learning**: Skill improvement in 3D development and networking

## Contingency Plans
- **If Multiplayer Too Complex**: Release as single-player with co-op "planned"
- **If Sprites Don't Work**: Fall back to simple 3D models or billboard sprites
- **If Scope Too Large**: Cut to single dungeon type, expand later
- **If Motivation Drops**: Pivot to smaller, completable version

## Tools & Resources
- **Engine**: Godot 4 (latest stable)
- **Assets**: Purchased dark fantasy sprite collection
- **Audio**: Free/purchased audio assets (TBD)
- **Community**: Discord server for feedback and motivation
- **Marketing**: Social media progress posts, dev blogs
