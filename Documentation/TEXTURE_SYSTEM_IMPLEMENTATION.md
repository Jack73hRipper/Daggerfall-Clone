# Texture System Implementation

## Overview
Added texture support to the procedural dungeon generation system, replacing solid color materials with texture-based materials for enhanced visual quality.

## Implementation Details

### Textures Added
- **Floor Texture**: `wood_floor.png` - Applied to all floor tiles in the dungeon
- **Wall Texture**: `stone_wall.png` - Applied to all wall tiles in the dungeon

### Technical Implementation
Modified `scripts/world/DaggerfallDungeonGenerator.gd`:

#### Floor Texture System
- Location: `create_floor_node()` function
- Texture: `res://assets/textures/materials/wood_floor.png`
- Fallback: Brown stone color (0.4, 0.3, 0.2) if texture fails to load
- Configuration:
  - UV scale: 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 (seamless tiling)
  - Filter: Linear filtering for smooth appearance

#### Wall Texture System
- Location: `create_wall_node()` function  
- Texture: `res://assets/textures/materials/stone_wall.png`
- Fallback: Light stone color (0.6, 0.5, 0.4) if texture fails to load
- Configuration:
  - UV scale: 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 (seamless tiling)
  - Filter: Linear filtering for smooth appearance

### Key Features
1. **Graceful Fallback**: If textures fail to load, the system falls back to solid colors
2. **Performance Optimized**: Textures are loaded once per tile creation
3. **Seamless Tiling**: Configured for proper UV mapping on Box mesh geometry
4. **Consistent Styling**: Maintains the medieval dungeon aesthetic

### Files Modified
- `scripts/world/DaggerfallDungeonGenerator.gd`
  - Enhanced `create_floor_node()` with wood floor texture
  - Enhanced `create_wall_node()` with stone wall texture

### Assets Location
- Floor texture: `assets/textures/materials/wood_floor.png`
- Wall texture: `assets/textures/materials/stone_wall.png`

## Testing
- Verified texture loading without errors in headless mode
- Confirmed procedural generation continues to work properly
- Built 1165+ floors and 1335+ walls successfully with texture materials

## Future Enhancements
- Add texture variation system for different room types
- Implement normal mapping for enhanced depth
- Add texture scaling options for different tile sizes
- Consider ceiling texture implementation
