- âœ… Input system (WASD movement, Sprint, Interact, Attack)

### ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS - Phase 2: Character Progression System (Week 2)

**Stats & Progression Foundation**
- âœ… D&D 5E-inspired character stats (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA)
- âœ… Character stats resource system with modifiers and derived stats
- ðŸ”„ Level progression and experience point tracking
- âœ… Health/Mana/Stamina system integration

**Equipment & Inventory System**
- âœ… Equipment manager with 10 slots (Main/Off Hand, Armor pieces, Accessories)
- âœ… 20-slot inventory system with item management
- ðŸ”„ Equipment bonus calculation and stat integration
- ðŸ”„ Item equipping/unequipping mechanics

**User Interface**
- âœ… Always-visible HUD with Health/Mana/Stamina bars
- âœ… Tabbed character menu (Stats/Equipment/Inventory)
- ðŸ”„ Right-click context menus for item interactions
- ðŸ”„ Clean, functional UI design with dungeon crawler aesthetic

**Integration Goals**
- [ ] Connect new stats system with existing combat mechanics
- [ ] Enhance weapon damage with STR/DEX modifiers
- [ ] Implement armor class calculation affecting combat
- [ ] Add character progression feedback and leveling rewards

### ðŸ“‹ UPCOMING - Phase 3: System Integration & Polish

**Combat Enhancement**
- [ ] Fix ground snapping system for proper floor positioning  
- [ ] Add combat audio (sword swings, hits, enemy sounds)
- [ ] Implement visual combat effects (damage numbers, hit particles)
- [ ] Enhanced weapon variety with stat requirements and bonuses

**Advanced Features**
- [ ] Character creation and customization system
- [ ] Skill system implementation with practical applications
- [ ] Save/load character progression
- [ ] Multiplayer networking foundation
- [ ] Advanced dungeon generation with loot scaling

## Development Approach
- **Single-player first** - Build core mechanics before networking
- **Godot 4** engine with low-poly pixelated graphics
- **3D character models** with full animation systems
- **Physics-based** item interactions and combat

## Technical Implementation

**Combat System Architecture**
- `PlayerController.gd`: Enhanced first-person controller with combat actions
- `AnimatedTarget.gd`: Advanced enemy AI with state machine (idle/patrol/pursue/attack/circle)
- `Weapon.gd`: Base weapon class with timing and damage systems
- Area3D collision detection with proper layer masking
- Tween-based weapon swing animations

**Character Animation Pipeline**
